Chebyshev Polynomials
======================

Generates the first `8` Chebyshev polynomials on the interval `[-1,1]`.

To run this code, you will need the <a href="https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran/cplot">CPLOT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran/Chebyshev">CHEBYSHEV</a> libraries.

You will also need `g++` on your machine. If you have other versions on `g++`, edit the `Chebyshev_Polynomials.sh` script to incorporate these changes.

You will also need `pdflatex` on your machine.

For running the script, set the permission as

	chmod 755 Chebyshev_Polynomials.sh

and then run the script as

	./Chebyshev_Polynomials.sh

To obtain more Chebyshev polynomials, you need to make the appropriate change in the script file `Chebyshev_Polynomials.sh`.
